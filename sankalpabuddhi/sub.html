   <h1>Submarine Building Course Program </h1> 
   

Week 1: Introduction to Submarine Design
In the first week, we will cover the basics of submarine design, including the history of submarines, key principles, and the different types of submarines. Students will gain a solid foundation in submarine construction and operation.
<br>

Week 2: Materials and Construction
This week, we'll dive into the materials used in submarine construction and the techniques involved in building a submarine. Topics will include pressure hulls, ballast systems, and various engineering considerations for submersible vessels.
<br>
Week 3: Propulsion Systems
<br>
Week 3 will focus on propulsion systems for submarines. Students will learn about different types of propulsion, such as nuclear, diesel-electric, and air-independent propulsion. We'll also discuss the pros and cons of each system.
<br>
Week 4: Submarine Operations and Safety
During this week, we'll explore various submarine operations and safety measures. Topics include underwater navigation, communication, life support systems, and emergency procedures. Students will gain insights into the challenges of operating a submarine and ensuring the well-being of the crew during extended underwater missions.
