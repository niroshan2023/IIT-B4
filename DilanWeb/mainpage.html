    <h1>Titan sub implosion: What we know about catastrophic event</h1>
    
    <P>US authorities say a debris field located in the North Atlantic leads to a conclusion that OceanGate's Titan submersible suffered a "catastrophic implosion" (a violent collapse inwards), instantly killing all five passengers on board.</P>
    <p>The US Navy says it detected sounds "consistent with an implosion" shortly after the sub lost contact on Sunday during a descent to the Titanic wreck at 3,800m (12,467ft) below sea level - but this information was only made public on Thursday.</p>
    <p>The loss of the deep-water vessel was finally confirmed after a huge search mission in the area off Canada's Newfoundland province.</p>
